# rust-playground

A repo dedicated for programmers of all levels to learn Rust through extensive clear examples and heavy commentation.
Will be actively updated.

## Running the examples

All the examples are included as assertless tests.

You can run all the examples at once from the terminal via 
```
cargo test -- --test-threads=1 --show-output
```
### If you are using VScode you can: ###
* Skip the terminal command above by Running the build task **"ctrl/cmd + shift + b"**
* Install the [**Rust-Analyzer**](*https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) and run single tests from within the editor.
